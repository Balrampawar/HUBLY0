# HUBLY0

> HUBLY0 is a web application designed to connect and share seamlessly.  

## 🌐 Live Demo  
Check it out here: [hubly-0-udnd.vercel.app](https://hubly-0-udnd.vercel.app/)  

## 🧰 Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React (bootstrapped with Create React App) |
| Styling | CSS (custom styles / components) |
| State Management | React Hooks / Context (if applicable) |

| Database | (Add if used — e.g. MongoDB, Firebase, etc.) |

| Version Control | Git + GitHub |

*(Update the backend/database rows if your app uses them — right now I only see React + Vercel from the live site.)*
